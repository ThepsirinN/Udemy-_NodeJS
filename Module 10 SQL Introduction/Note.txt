- dynamic route use ":params"
- delete should appear before dynamic route
- access params by using req.params.Param_name in the controller (relate to the name in route )
- <%- include('url', {param(in):param(out)}) %>
- add + before variable it will casting type to int
- require.main.filename does not automatically create the file we need to create json file manaully. Otherwise, It'll generate amount of error
- query is for ?param *** like get in PHP 
- Delete with filter out 
- if delete product. It will delete cart (On delete = CASSADE in python)
